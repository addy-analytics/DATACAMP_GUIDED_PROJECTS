# Python-DataCamp-Projects
ðŸ“Š Python projects on DataCamp
  Utilize the fundamental abilities acquired in the Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to handle and present movie and TV data. This involves tackling various problem-solving situations, refining expertise in data analysis, manipulation, and visualization techniques. In these assignments, I'll utilize the expertise acquired in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to address a practical data science challenge. By diving into tasks like investigating if the duration of Netflix movies is decreasing and identifying the most featured guest stars in "The Office's" most popular episode, I'll employ a range of techniques from basic lists and loops to advanced tools like pandas and matplotlib. 
  
  This project is invaluable in honing my proficiency in a crucial data science practice: exploratory data analysis. It equips me with the ability to handle raw data effectively and draw meaningful conclusions from the plots I generate during the analysis process.

## 1.  Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib
