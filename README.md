# Python-DataCamp-Projects
ðŸ“Š Python projects on DataCamp
  Utilize the fundamental abilities acquired in the Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to handle and present movie and TV data. This involves tackling various problem-solving situations, refining expertise in data analysis, manipulation, and visualization techniques. In these assignments, I'll utilize the expertise acquired in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to address a practical data science challenge. By diving into tasks, I'll employ a range of techniques from basic lists and loops to advanced tools like pandas and matplotlib. 
  
  Thes project are invaluable in honing my proficiency in a crucial data science practice: exploratory data analysis. It equips me with the ability to handle raw data effectively and draw meaningful conclusions from the plots I generate during the analysis process.

## 1.  Project Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
### ðŸ“ºProject Task
  1. Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:
    - Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
    - Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
     
  2. A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
    - Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
    - Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
    - Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
    - Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
     
  3. A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25 
  
  4. Correctly labeling the axes as:
    - A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
    - An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
    - A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"
     
  5. Provide the name of one of the guest stars who was in the most watched Office episode.
