# Project: Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
Python projects on DataCamp
Utilize the fundamental abilities acquired in the Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to handle and present movie and TV data. This involves tackling various problem-solving situations, refining expertise in data analysis, manipulation, and visualization techniques.

## ðŸ›  Description
In these assignments, I'll utilize the expertise acquired in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to address a practical data science challenge. By diving into tasks like investigating if the duration of Netflix movies is decreasing and identifying the most featured guest stars in "The Office's" most popular episode, I'll employ a range of techniques from basic lists and loops to advanced tools like pandas and matplotlib.

This project is invaluable in honing my proficiency in a crucial data science practice: exploratory data analysis. It equips me with the ability to handle raw data effectively and draw meaningful conclusions from the plots I generate during the analysis process.

## ðŸ“ºProjects
### Guided project
Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

Project tasks
1. Loading a friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!


### Unguided project

Project task
1. Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:
2. Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
3. Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
4. A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
  - Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
  - Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
  - Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
  - Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
5. A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
6. A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
7. An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
8. A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"
9. Provide the name of one of the guest stars (hint, there were multiple!) who was in the most watched Office episode.
